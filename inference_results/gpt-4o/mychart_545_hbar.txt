The chart depicts a logarithmic scale showing horizontal bars for different directors and exercise prices across the years 2016, 2017, and 2018. To extract the exact number of options for Steve Bertamini, Gregory Baxter, and Paul Brandling, one must sum the lengths of bars excluding Russell Yardley and Exercise price for each year. These lengths are visually represented and need to be interpreted from the chart.
