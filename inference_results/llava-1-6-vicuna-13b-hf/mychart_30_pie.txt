The purpose of including contingent liabilities in a company's financial statements is to provide a comprehensive view of the company's financial position and to ensure a complete understanding of its potential future obligations. These liabilities may or may not become actual expenses, but they represent potential risks or commitments that could impact the company's financial health. Investors, analysts, and stakeholders use this information to assess the company's financial health, evaluate its risk profile, and make informed decisions.
