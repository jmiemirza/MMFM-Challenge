One solution to dealing with Delhi Belly could be to avoid eating raw vegetables, drink bottled water or use water filters, and ensure that food is cooked thoroughly to reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses. Additionally, when dining, choose reputable restaurants and avoid street food that may not have the same sanitary standards. Travelers can also carry medication such as antidiarrheal tablets in case they get affected by food-related illnesses.
