According to the legend presented, the Xana from Spain is a figure to be wary of because she is a shapeshifting water spirit with hypnotic voices. Her seductive abilities may lure people into her care, resulting in them becoming lost or entrapped under her spell, which can lead to dangerous and even fatal consequences if they wander off or fall into a deep sleep.
