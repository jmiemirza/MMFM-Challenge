Managing expectations when investing in fine wine involves understanding that it is a long-term, high-risk asset with fluctuating market conditions and valuations. When investing, set a clear investment goal and allocate a small portion of your portfolio to wine. As wine appreciates, it can diversify your investments and offer a stable value over time. However, it's important to remember that market trends and demand for specific wines can be volatile, so patience is key.
