To calculate the depreciation of the 'Trademarks' specifically, I would need to see the values for the bars under 'Amalgamated' for this category in the 'Cost' and 'Net' columns. The 'Net' and 'Acquisition' columns might provide a rough estimate for the depreciation, but without seeing the specific values, I am unable to give an accurate numerical answer.
