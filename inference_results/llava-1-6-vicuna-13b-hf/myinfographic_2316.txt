It took roughly 200 man-hours to complete the programming of Spacewar!, which was written on a DEC Interactive Mini computer. The conditions in which it was developed were characterized by the use of a two-player game that simulated the launch of missiles and collisions among space ships in the game, with each ship affected by the gravitation of the other and space distortions where two ships would pass, creating the first known simulation of real-world physics in a computer. Spacewar was one of the earliest computer games created and has been influential in the field of computer science and gaming history.
