The company's hiring process is asserted to focus on the candidate's qualifications without considering alternative or 'better' options, implying a strong emphasis on ensuring the right fit for the role and the company. This can also be interpreted as a reassurance to potential employees that they will not be considered for a project or role that is not ideal for them or might not align with their experience. The process seems to be centered on addressing the candidate's concerns by addressing whether they would actually consider the candidate for another project or role, thus building trust in the hiring process.
