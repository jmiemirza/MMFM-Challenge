Calcium ions (Ca^2+) are involved in muscle contraction by regulating the interaction of the actin and myosin filaments. When calcium ions bind to these filaments, they form cross-bridges that cause the actin and myosin to contract and ultimately cause muscle contraction. This process is a coordinated and controlled process that is part of the muscle's contraction and relaxation cycle.
