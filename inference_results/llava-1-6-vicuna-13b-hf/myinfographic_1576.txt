An examination of the infographic reveals that food consumption during training and the race varies significantly. During training, the focus is on maintaining and building muscle mass with an emphasis on carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. However, during the race, the focus shifts to a much lower calorie intake to minimize weight and maintain energy levels for rowing. This change in diet composition helps the athletes manage their weight, optimize performance, and support their bodies during the physically demanding rowing race.
