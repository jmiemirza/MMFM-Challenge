In the infographic, the categories of conservation status are differentiated by the use of symbols next to each species' name. Green arrows indicate species that have a good conservation status (e.g., their population is stable and not at risk), while red arrows indicate species with a poor conservation status (e.g., their population is declining or threatened). These symbols are placed next to the corresponding images of the baby animals within the infographic.
