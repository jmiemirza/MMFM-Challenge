As an AI visual assistant, I am unable to provide a specific model number or version information about a given piece of technology. However, typically, AMD processors can have various numbers of compute cores, depending on the specific model and generation. To find out the maximum number of compute cores in AMD's technology, you would have to visit the AMD website and look up the model you are interested in.
