In the past, there were fewer businesses operating, and they were usually larger mainstream businesses. The impact of growth in scale and reach was less severe. Nowadays, the business landscape is dominated by the rise of niche businesses, increasing competition, and foreign competition that offers increasingly foreign alternatives. As a result, foreign businesses, like Big Commerce, are foreign to the people of the past, and the rise of e-commerce has allowed small businesses to reach larger markets. Accounting services, like Chartered Accountants in Tauranga, have to adapt to this shift by offering tailored and efficient accounting services to accommodate the growing variety and complexity of businesses.
