When looking at office space, consider the existing or needed office size to accommodate growth for your organization. Check for access to amenities, parking, and proximity to public transport. Also, consider convenience for employees, and if you anticipate hiring more people, whether you'll have enough space to fit them. Lastly, look for a cost-effective option that meets your company's budget and long-term growth projections.
