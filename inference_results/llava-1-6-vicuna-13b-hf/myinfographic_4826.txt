The four ways to make Civics learning come alive are as follows: 1) Think local! (Explore civics through the lens of local issues), 2) Go virtual! (Engage in simulations and virtual reality experiences), 3) Create history (Learn about civics by analyzing the past), 4) Relive history (Understand the context of current events in the light of historical lessons)
