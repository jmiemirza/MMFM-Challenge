In the infographic provided, the 'R' stands for the Interest Rate (R), which is applied to calculate the monthly payments and the total interest charged on an auto loan. When considering interest rates in the context of an auto loan, the higher the interest rate, the larger the cost of borrowing in terms of interest and the total loan amount. This increases the monthly payments and the overall cost of the vehicle in the long run.
